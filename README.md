# complex_fmri
This repo contains R and C code accompanying the Annals of Applied Statistics paper 
["Complex-valued time series modeling for improved activation detection in fMRI studies"](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1536652961).

The R functions are intended to be the user interface so I have written comments about them.  The C functions are called by these R functions and represent the "inner workings" of the code so I have not commented these (though I am happy to include more upon request).

I have only included the code related to the models for complex-valued fMRI time series here.  I have excluded the code related to the models for the magnitude-only time series, though I can include this upon request.
